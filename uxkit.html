               Not all designers are good drawers. Also, drawing takes time. With this toolkit a web designer has all the elements of a website in hand and can puzzle himself a good website which will fit the specific user.
               <br><br>


I made this toolkit for my colleges at JAAF Design where I did my internship last year. I was inspired by a toolkit I saw on the internet and made my own twist at it with more specifics and as much elements that a website should and could need.
