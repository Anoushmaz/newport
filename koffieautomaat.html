            <h1>Coffee Machine</h1>
            <h4>User Centered Design, 2017</h4>
            <p>
               School is everyday. School is early in the morning. Same as work. For this, we need good coffee and for sure a good coffeemachine experience.
               <br><br>
The company MAAS International owns the coffeemachines on my university and until now, the experience is still not what we want. There are a lot of missunderstandings with the machine and the user if you just want to grab a simple coffee. Because of this, we made a re-design of the machine by just looking to the user journey.

The whole process of defining this user journey and a better view of the design choices is downloadable below.
