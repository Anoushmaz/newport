            <p>
               NEMO is a science museum in Amsterdam made for children. They already have a beautiful logo for their company, but for this project we needed to make a re-design.

               <br><br>


I started my process by visiting the museum myself. I made pictures and was observing everything I saw. Then, I brainstormed. A lot. Looking at the feeling that the children have in the museum and how everyone behaves including the parents.

In the end, I made two re-designs as you can see at the picture. Below, you can download slides of the powerpoint where I show my inspiration and steps to get to these logos.
