               We sleep for one third of our lives. That's crazy right? Some people have issues trying to fall a sleep. So does nightworkers in hospitals for example. They work in the night and sleep over day. Besides that it's light over day what is frustrating to fall a sleep easily, the sleeping patterns for such a worker is also not in shape anymore. For this, we made an interactive product named Zenza.

               <br><br>


Zenza is a little light in the shape of a litte tree that you can place on your sleep furniture. It's connected with an app which will tell you excectly when to sleep and when to wake up. The tree helps with with with a dimming and waking up light.
